# 🧠 Car Purchase Prediction – Technical Notes 📘

This document summarizes all the technical concepts, steps, and explanations related to the **Car Purchase Prediction** Machine Learning project. It includes both coding and ML theory in simple, easy-to-understand terms.

## 🚗 What Does This Project Do?

This project predicts how much a customer might spend on purchasing a car based on various features like age, salary, debt, and net worth. It uses a supervised machine learning technique called **Linear Regression** to learn from past data and make predictions on new data.

## 🔄 Project Workflow (End-to-End)

1. **Collect Data** – Load CSV file using `pandas.read_csv()`
2. **Clean Data** – Remove unwanted columns, handle missing values
3. **Encode Data** – Convert categorical data like gender and country using `pd.get_dummies()`
4. **Split Data** – Use `train_test_split()` to divide into train and test sets
5. **Train Model** – Apply `LinearRegression()` to fit the model on training data
6. **Predict** – Use `model.predict()` on the test data
7. **Evaluate** – Measure accuracy using `r2_score()` and error with `mean_squared_error()`
8. **Visualize** – Scatter plot actual vs predicted values using `matplotlib.pyplot`

## 🤖 Machine Learning Concepts (Simplified)

### 1. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning teaches a computer to learn patterns from past data to make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

### 2. Types of ML
- **Supervised Learning** – You give input + correct answer (e.g., car price) → ✅ Used here
- **Unsupervised Learning** – No correct answers (used for clustering)
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Learns from rewards and punishments

### 3. Regression vs Classification
- **Regression**: Predict numbers (like salary, price)
- **Classification**: Predict categories (like male/female)

> ✅ Your project is a **Regression** task.

## 📐 Linear Regression – Explained

### Formula:  
```
y = mx + c
```

- `y` = target value (car purchase amount)  
- `x` = features (salary, age, etc.)  
- `m` = coefficient (slope of the line)  
- `c` = intercept (where it crosses Y-axis)

This draws a straight line through data and learns best-fit values.

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

| Metric           | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `r2_score()`     | Accuracy score (closer to 1 is better)               |
| `mean_squared_error()` | Measures average prediction error (lower = better) |

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- Encoding non-numeric columns (gender, country)
- Unicode errors due to special characters in print
- Pushing project to GitHub from Git Bash
- Authentication and repo not found errors

---

## ✅ How I Solved Them

- Used `pd.get_dummies()` to convert text to numeric
- Removed emojis/symbols from print to avoid `UnicodeEncodeError`
- Configured GitHub CLI and used correct repo URL
- Used Git Bash for smoother command-line experience
